# Configuration

Here are the configuration options, set to the default values, for this service. If you are unsure about where this goes or what this means, we *highly recommend* scanning the [services documentation](https://docs.lando.dev/config/services.html) to get a good handle on how the magicks work.

Also note that the below options are in addition to the [build steps](https://docs.lando.dev/config/services.html#build-steps) and [overrides](https://docs.lando.dev/config/services.html#overrides) that are available to every service.

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    type: redis:5
    persist: false
    portforward: false
    config:
      server: SEE BELOW
```

## Persisting data

This option is pretty straightforward. Use `persist: true` to persist the cache's data between restarts and rebuilds.

## Port forwarding

`portforward` will allow you to access this service externally by assigning a port directly on your host's `localhost`. Note that `portforward` can be set to either `true` or a specific `port` but we *highly recommend* you set it to `true` unless you have pretty good knowledge of how port assignment works or you have a **very** compelling reason for needing a locked down port.

`portforward: true` will prevent inevitable port collisions and provide greater reliability and stability across Lando apps. That said, one downside of `portforward: true` is that Docker will assign a different port every time you restart your application. You can read more about accessing services externally [over here](https://docs.lando.dev/guides/external-access.html).

`tl;dr`

**Recommended**

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    type: redis
    portforward: true
```

**Not recommended**

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    type: redis
    portforward: 6379
```

## Using a custom redis.conf

You may need to override our [default redis server config](https://github.com/lando/lando/tree/master/plugins/lando-services/services/redis) with your own [custom redis config file](https://redis.io/topics/config).

If you do this, you must use a file that exists inside your application and express it relative to your project root as shown below:

**A hypothetical project**

Note that you can put your configuration files anywhere inside your application directory. We use a `config` directory in the below example but you can call it whatever you want such as `.lando`.

```bash
./
|-- config
   |-- redis.conf
|-- .lando.yml
```

**Landofile's redis config**

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    type: redis
    config:
      server: config/redis.conf
```

## Getting information

You can get connection and credential information about your redis instance by running [`lando info`](https://docs.lando.dev/cli/info.html). It may also be worth checking out our [accessing services externally guide](https://docs.lando.dev/guides/external-access.html).
